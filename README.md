# factorial
# Factorial and Sum of Factorials

This program contains two main functions:

- `fact(n)`: calculates the factorial of a positive integer `n`.
- `sumFact(n)`: calculates the sum of the factorials of all integers from 1 to `n`.

## Function Explanation

- The `fact(n)` function calculates the factorial of `n` using a `for` loop.
- The `sumFact(n)` function uses the `fact` function to sum the factorials of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

## How to Use

The program asks the user to input a positive integer and then prints out the factorial of that number as well as the sum of factorials from 1 to that number.
